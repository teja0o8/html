HTML:
HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.

The anatomy of element:
The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element, wrapped in opening.
The content: This is the content of the element.
The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends.

Nesting elements:Elements can be placed within other elements.

Attributes: Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.


Anatomy of an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>: doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML.

<html></html>: The <html> element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.

<head></head>: The <head> element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more.

<meta charset="UTF-8">: This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. 

<title></title>: The <title> element sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. 

<body></body>: The <body> element contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.

Comments: Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding

To write an HTML comment: wrap it in the special markers <!-- --> . 

Hyperlinks: Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address.

Basic sections of a document:
header:Usually strips across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline.

navigation bar: Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs.

main content:A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc.

sidebar: this is contextual to what is contained in the main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.

footer: strips across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info.

Line breaks and horizontal rules:
Two elements that you'll use occasionally and will want to know about are <br> and <hr>.

<br>: the line break element. <br> creates a line break in a paragraph.

<hr>: the thematic break element.<hr> elements create a horizontal rule in the document that denotes a thematic change in the text.
